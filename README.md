# Welcome!

I am an Assistant Professor at **Yale**, in the **Department of Statistics and Data Science**. My research broadly explores theory and foundations of machine learning, with a particular interest in addressing modern challenges such as robustness to adversarial examples and distribution shifts.

## Prospective Students:
I am looking for motivated PhD students to join my group. If you are interested in working with me, please apply to our [PhD program](#) and mention my name. If you are already at Yale, feel free to email me with a short description of your research interests and your CV.

## Background:
Prior to Yale, I spent one year at **UC Berkeley** as a FODSI-Simons postdoctoral researcher. I received my PhD from the **Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago**, where I was fortunate to be advised by **Nathan Srebro**. During my PhD, I primarily thought about questions related to learning machine learning models robust against adversarial examples, through the lens of learning theory.

For a broad overview, you can:

Before TTIC, I completed a five-year program (combined BS/MS) in computer science and engineering at **Penn State**. While there, I enjoyed working with **Daniel Kifer** and **Sean Hallgren** on problems in machine learning and quantum computational complexity.
